                    <h3>My complete name is Dharyle B(Bendigosa) Abatayo. I was born on February 20, 2005, so as of know i'm 19 years old.</h3>
                    <p>Unforgettable memories:
                      When i was in Elementary i got a memory that i can't forget, it happens two times in Kindergarten and in Grade 1. I poop into my
                      underwear. Luckily since our house is near the campus thanks to my grandmother i got rescued immediately. In high i also have a lot
                      of memories with my bestfriend. First, we got suspended for 1 week cause we're doing a truth or dare challenge. Which is, if one of us
                      declined the challenge she or he must bought a food for everyone. One of our friend chooses a dare and the dare was to dance in the
                      roof of our stage. But the unllucky hits us our teacher caught us in action. Second, We got our selves into the guidance office cause
                      me and my friends jump into the gate to buy some foods. But unfortunately our school forbidden us to go outside the campus. One of our
                      subject teacher caught us so she immediately call us to the office. Lastly, i got into a fight which everyone in campus was watching. The
                      reason why i got into a fight just beacuse my classmate was jelous of me being the best dancer in our school. He gossip a wrong information
                      about me which led me to angriness. I scrambled his faces until i scratch his ears and the wond was a little bit big. So again we got to the
                      principals office with our parents and settle things.</p>
